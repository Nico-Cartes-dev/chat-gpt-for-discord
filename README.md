# chat-gpt-for-discord
use chat gpt in discord
To set up this project, you need to create a ".env" file. Within this file, you'll have to input your Discord and OpenAI APIs. Below is the format:

openai_api_key=""
discord_bot_token=""

Additionally, you'll need to install the following dependencies using Node.js:

npm install discord.js   
npm install --save-dev nodemon # for development
npm install openai

It's important to note that with Node.js, I'll provide a link on how to install it. Also, please be aware that the GPT-3.5 API has limitations on queries. 
If you discover any way to increase the number of queries, feel free to contact me as it's an ongoing development.
